I'm a programmer, musician, and <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com">author</a>.  I speak frequently at national and regional conferences and spends my days currently as a tech lead at LivingSocial in Washington, DC. I've written applications in C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Scala, and many others, on large and small teams. As a developer, I believe in clean code, making it right, providing a great user experience and using the right tool for the job.  As a bass player, I believe in using a pick, locking it down and ripping off Peter Hook.  As an author, I insist on the Oxford Command, try to avoid semi-colons, and really hate title case.
