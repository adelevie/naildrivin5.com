{% blockquote Old Bene Gesserit Proverb, Paraphrased from <i>Dune</i> %}
When mocking and dynamic typing travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's to late.
