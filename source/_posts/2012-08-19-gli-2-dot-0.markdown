[GLI][gli] 2.0 is out!  GLI is _the best_ way to make a "command-suite" command line interface.  If you need to make a complex
command line app that takes subcommands, like `git` or `gem`, GLI is the most powerful and easy-to-use way to do that.

<!-- more -->

Unlike `thor` or `trollop`, GLI sits on top of `OptionParser`, giving you access to its powerful features.  GLI-powered apps have
fully-featured help systems - you just need to provide a bit of documentation.  There's also support for a basic application
lifecycle and with almost no code, you have an awesome, well-behaved command-line app that's easy to write, easy to test, easy to
use, and easy to maintain.

## New Features

* Arbitrarily deep sub- and sub-sub-commands.  Think `git remote add`.
* Uses `OptionParser`, meaning your command-line options can benefit from type conversions, validation checks, negatability, and
  all the other awesome that comes from `OptionParser`.
* Whole new help system that shows command-line invocation examples, generated from your code.
* Bootstrapped apps now include an `.rvmrc` and a shell for acceptance testing via [aruba].
* More flexible documentation-generation systems to allow any format of documentation to be generated (currently, only RDoc is
  implemented).
* More easily structure your code in external files
* Lots of bug-fixes

## Get Started

```sh
> gem install gli
> gli init your-new-app
```

## Learn More

* [Walkthrough][gli] of GLI's features at a more detailed level
* A more sophisticated application with [annotated source][app]
* Source code on [Github]
* [API Documentation][rdoc]
* [Buy the book][clibook] - One of the running examples uses GLI, and the examples should all work with 2.0
