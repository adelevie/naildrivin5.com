At the start of 2011, I [blogged][2010-post] about a "professional goals" file I found on my computer, and
compared it to what happened.  I kindof enjoyed the exercise, so here's a repeat.

## 2011

Here's what was on my list of goals for 2011:


### Deploy my iPhone app to App Store

Sadly, [my app][winebrain] is still floundering.  With the release of iOS5, it's even got some bugs.  I would like to either
re-implement or at least beef it up and get it into the store.  With the book done (see below), this might happen.

### Speak at at least 2 conferences

Done and done.  I was lucky enough to speak at more than two conferences this year, including [RubyNation][rubynation],
[RubyConf][rubyconf], [GoGaRuCo][GoGaRuCo], [OSCON][oscon] and [Ruby Midwest][rubymidwest].  It was a ton of fun, but 
exhausting.  Probably going to dial that back this year.

### Publish my command-line application book

My [book][book] on command-line applications in Ruby is *done*.  It took most of my free time this year to get it to completion,
but it's done and should be out of beta real soon.  I love writing and so I'm inclined to count this against myi "blog twice a
month" thing, but it took a lot more time than I thought it would.

### Develop and deploy an iPad app

Not even close :(

### Blog twice a month

I barely managed an average of one post/month.  This year will hopefully be better.  My main problem is that it's hard to find
interesting things to blog about.  I would much rather my blog be like [Marco Arment's][marco] than a grab bag of technical junk,
but I also don't want to have a blog like [Daring Fireball][daringfireball] that is just opinions and reactions (not that I don't
think that's a great blog or a great way to write, but it's just not what *I* want to blog about).

### Learn JavaScript more betterer

I spent almost no time improving my JavaScript skills.  I'm not particularly sad about it, but I would still like to be better at
it.

### Get my rudimentary scaladoc doclet accepted.

I think that my patch inspired a change in the scaladoc tool that gives it doclet-like abilities, but I couldn't find the time to
do anything with it.   The Scala documentation is much improved over the initial version of Scaladoc2, but it's still pretty bad.
Sadly, I'm not writing a lot of Scala at work, so I don't have the time or motivation to do much about it.

## 2012

All in all, I didn't hit everything I'd hoped, but I'm still happy with how things panned out.  I think the theme of 2011 for me
was "Don't Get Pigeon-holed".  


While my job at [Opower][opower] was great, I was doing a lot of Java and ready to move on, both technically and product-wise.  Instead of spending my
free-time refining my Ruby skills, I now apply them daily (along with a [great team][livingsocialdevs]), freeing up my after-work
time to other pursuits.

So, what *are* those pursuits?  I'm not looking to dive into some esoteric new bleeding-edge language at the moment.  I'd still
like to get better at JavaScript and Objective-C, and that might be enough "new stuff" for me for this year.
Additionally, I'd like to:

* Keep writing, either the blog or a short self-published thing
* Complete [methadone][methadone] and release [GLI2][gli2], so both of those projects can be in maintenance-mode for a while
* Find a way to keep up with my Scala.

Beyond that, hopefully I can spend more time on music and cooking this year.  Amy and I had a blast in [Culebra][culebra]
just making up dishes using the limited ingredients available on the island and I'm just tired of eating sandwiches.
