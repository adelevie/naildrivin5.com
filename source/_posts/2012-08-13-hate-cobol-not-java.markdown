Another stinker from [jelastic], this time on how [Java's not that bad][post]:

{% blockquote %}
So next week someone will invent another DSL that makes Twitter easier to use, but your bank will be writing new COBOL to more efficiently transfer funds to another Bank. Weâ€™re embarrassing ourselves with our petty arguments.
{% endblockquote %}

So, because some industries are still using COBOL, we should stop advancing the state of the art, which involves moving onto more
modern languages than Java, and go help out these poor billion-dollar industries get into the cloud?
