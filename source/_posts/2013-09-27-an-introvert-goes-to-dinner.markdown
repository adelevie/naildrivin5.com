I'm trying out [Medium](http://www.medium.com) as a place to do non-technical writing, mostly to keep this blog's topic focused
on technology.  I won't cross-post everything here, but this is my first one, [An Introvert Goes to Dinner](https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/3c66705aac17).  Excerpt:

> I actually enjoy solo trips like this. It's a chance to be as alone as possible: I'm in a city were I don't know anyone, typically with a lot of free time outside of whatever reason brings me to said city. I know I won't have to talk to anyone.
