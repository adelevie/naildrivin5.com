John Siracusa has, in his laser-focused, analytical style, perfectly captured something about technology that I always knew, but never *knew* I knew.   His latest post, [Technological Conservatism][hypercritical] is a must read:

> Beneath what seems like a reasonable feature request lurks the heart of technological conservatism: **what was and is always shall be.**

(emphasis his).

I love everything about this, and it's a helluva lot better than [Steve Yegge's stinker][yegge].

Siracusa's article inspires me in two ways:

* Stop holding "what I know" so dearly.  "Lead or bleed", as [Chad Fowler says][passionate]
* Stop accepting unjustified idioms & conventions as being "more correct".  "That's just the way it's done" is often the best
explanation for doing things a particular way, but it's not actually a legitimate reason for anything.
