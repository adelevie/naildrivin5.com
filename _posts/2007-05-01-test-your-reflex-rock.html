A while back, I went to see Electric Six at the <a href="http://www.blackcatdc.com">Black Cat</a>.  The opening band was so-Cal's <a href="http://www.textyourreflex.net">Test Your Reflect</a>, who play poppy 80s-inspired new-new-wave, along the lines of The Bravery.  They absolutely <b>rocked</b> and jammed nonstop for their 40 minute set.  Electric Six looked so lame in comparison (not to mention that Electric Six's songs are fairly weak).

I went to their merch table to pick up their CD and was given a sampler with a couple songs on it; their CD wasn't out til later in the month.  Really annoying; how could they put on such a manly rock show and then not have their CD?!?!?  I went home and ripped the tracks off the sampler, and then <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijacked</a> the tunes off their myspace page.  I forgot when their album came out until yesterday, when I picked it up from iTunes (get it <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=252468240&s=143441">here</a>).  Needless to say, it captures their live show and is my new favorite album.  Start-to-finish, each song is a hit, save for the slow one (there's always a slow number, and they always suck).  The single, "Pieces of the Sun", is a great song, but not the stand out track.  For me, the bittersweet "Forever Young" updated "I'm Not Sorry" is one of the best 5 minute songs ever, but "New Year" is just a non-stop upbeat rocker.  I was singing along with the chorus halfway through the first one.  Anyway, this shit is <b>on</b>.  I also picked up !!!'s latest, which is pretty lame.  A few nice grooves, but mostly just meandering pointless jamming.
