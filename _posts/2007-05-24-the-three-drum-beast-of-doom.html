The drumbeats guaranteed to improve any song are as follows:

<ul>
<li><b>The Disco Beat</b> - As exemplified in all disco songs and numerous new-new-wave songs that are popular these days.  Franz Ferdinand's "Take Me Out" uses it as well, but The Bravery's "Public Service Announcement" is one of my favorite uses in recent history</li>
<li><b>16ths on the Hat</b> - The staple of every  Joy Division, New Order and new-new-wave band's song is the constant chattering on the high-hat.  Instant energy, instant drive.  Cannot get enough of this beat</li>
<li><b>Madchester Beat</b> - Blur's "There's No Other Way" is <b>all</b> about this whitened-up hip-hop beat, and played with sufficient tempo, this beat will always work.  Always.  Enough groove to satisfy those who scoff at 16ths on the Hat, but not enough to piss me off.  It's got to be fast, though</li>
</ul>
