<b>Overall: 1 Star</b>

<p>
<i>Anyone</i> - Opening guitar riff is getting me pretty excited.  Bassline's a bit jumpy, but it's cool.  Guy sounds a bit like Sting, but, strangely, not as much as the Mute Math guy.  You'd think Sting's actual genetic material would put him ahead.  At any rate, it's a good thing, cause we already have Sting.  The chorus is decent for an opener.  Song's got a nice stomping feel to it.  Not much to it, but inoffensive and has prepared me for the hopefully deeper songs to follow.

</p>
<p>
<i>Death Machine</i> - has a groove, but still a nice loud noisy guitar part.  Comparisons to the Police are not to be avoided here, but it's not a total soundalike.  The singing keeps the energy high, even though the tempo is still a bit "mid".  Can't help feeling this is a lot more 90s than it should be.  He's getting really high here, and it's not really pleasant.  Chorus is nice.  Sting's adulty contemporary soft rock would never contain the word "fuck" in it.  

</p>
<p>
<i>Two Sisters</i> - I think this is the single/hit.  Another semi-groovy mid-tempo number.  It's moving on and the energy is high, due to the guy's voice, which is in a nice "high but not too high" register.  I sorta zoned out during this song.  This has the same problem as the first two songs, which is that the energy level is very constant and there's not a lot of variation in the arrangements. Sorta standard rock songs.  Without Sting, Jr. these songs would be really lame, I'm thinking

</p>
<p>
<i>It's a Lie</i> - The rhythm is getting changed up here some, but it descneds back into 90s rock territory.  Sounding really Sting-y here, and that's pulling it even further into the past, sound-wise.  The verses are doing some vague Interpol-y stuff, which is nice, but the chorus kinda ruins it.  Still, it's better then the other tracks so far.

</p>
<p>
<i>Left Side of the Brain</i> - The ballad.  I do not like ballads.  At least when Poison plays one, you aren't expected to take it seriously.  The hack drumming is tedious.   I really dislike this style; late 90s grunge-esque drum patterns with the psuedo-groove.  This shit really belongs in the 90s (when it may have been huge, though who knows if this kid could even drive then).

</p>
<p>
<i>Cold Water Symmetry</i> - starts off with a bit of a departure, feel-wise, but the whole thing is mixed like a major-label post-grunge "alt rock" band that I don't think really serves any of this all that well.  It quickly reverts back to boring mid-tempo rock.  I'm leaving it after 2:24.

</p>
<p>
<i>Running the Country</i> - This better not be some political bullshit.  Synth-sounding verse thanks to Line 6, no doubt.  Chorus is decent, except the lyrics, which are dumb.  "Running the country...into the ground".  Blah.

</p>
<p>
<i>Drink</i> - Now THIS is the ballad.  Just acoustic guitar and Sting 2.0.  I hate songs like this.  Sounds like he's trying to squeeze one out.  His Americana pronounciation is just transparent and lame.

</p>
<p>
<i>Presuppose</i> - It's like Bush and STP got together for the soundtrack of Singles 2: Hunting Season.  Sorry, this shit sucks.

</p>
<p>
<i>Cross the Line</i> - A little side stick beat starts this one off to let us know they are taking it a bit easy.  The building guitar part cues what should've been a big chorus.  Instead, it pulls us back to mid-tempo hell.  This shit is so boring and mainstream, but not even in that good way that mainstream music can be sometimes.

</p>
<p>
<i>Fake Light from the Sun</i> - These song titles sound like they are all deep and shit.  I'm guessing a close inspection of the lyrics would not be advised.  At least he hasn't wasted my time with more than 11 songs.  This one is very slow, very laidback, and he has totally lost the Sting sound in favor of a guy imitating Nickleback...badly.
</p>
<p>
This thing should be placed into a rocket and either shot into the sun or at least back to the 90s where it would not have been on my radar at all.  Horrible.  I wish iTunes took returns.
