<b>Overall: 1 star</b>
<!--more-->
<p>
<i>Comin' Down</i> - High Energy rocker with some classic rock yell-y vocals.  Not a great song, but decent energy.

</p>
<p>
<i>Superstar Tradesman</i> - Must be the single.  This song completely rocks out.  Good hook in the chorus, with a cool high-strummy guitar part.  My head was bobbing up and down almost immediately.

</p>
<p>
<i>Same Jeans</i> - Pretty standard 3-chord rock, unfortunately with harmonica.  Doesn't ruin it, but the singer's annoying classic rock voice is shining through a bit much.  A nice hook, though and I can dig it.

</p>
<p>
<i>Don't Tell Me</i> - Annoyingly bland blues-rock song that deserves to open for some washed up band at a county fair.

</p>
<p>
<i>Skag Trendy</i> - This shit is starting to sound amateur.  Another three chord snoozer.  I like simple and all, but this is just boring.  His voice is really irritating here, with lots of screamy falsetto yelps.  This album is losing it for me.

</p>
<p>
<i>The Don</i> - Faux-reggae rhythm, which is OK by me.  I'm really hating his voice.  It started off like I could be a smiths-esque pop song, but kind devolved into a circus-band cover of a Franz Ferdinand b-side.  

</p>
<p>
<i>Face for the Radio</i> - Another acoustic simplistic song like Same Jeans.  I guess the reason this doesn't completely piss me off is that he's playing the song with some pep and energy.  I think it's lazy arranging, but he's not wasting my time with sub-100BPM tempos and faux emotional whispy vocal delivery.  I can't say I really like this song, but it's not annoying me or anything.  I think with a full band, 10-15BPM more speed, this would be enjoyable.

</p>
<p>
<i>Wasted Little DJ's</i> - Wasted little DJ's what?  Learn how to use an apostrophe asshole.  Since this is the "Single Version" it might be the single instead of Superstar Tradesman.  Despite how dumb the name is, it's a decent rocker.  Driving.  Always driving, thank GOD.  His voice sounds so much better when he doesn't have time or space to start "emoting" and just delivers the song to us.  Tired guitar licks are kept to a minimum (though not totally absent).  Kinda loses steam in the middle and could have a better chorus.  Amazingly, the guitar solo is kinda good and adds energy.  I was totally expecting some really lame blues crud.  The second best track on the album so far.

</p>
<p>
<i>Grans for Tea</i> - Similar vibe to the non-single songs.  Not driving, kinda bouncy.  For whatever reason, this rhythms bring out the worst in his voice.  Song is decently constructed, but his voice pretty much ruins it.  So "low-fi" and crappy.  He sounds like your average "rock singer" who is perpetually stuck working in a music store or playing in a cover band.

</p>
<p>
<i>Dance Into the Night</i> - 50s vibe, but more upbeat.  The song isn't very good, however.  The lack of decent songwriting makes the song sound really tired and typical and ultimatley boring.  This one DOES have a tired lame-ass guitar solo in it.  I think this guy is just no capable of giving a truly great vocal performance, cause he's singing his ass off here and it's just forgettable.

</p>
<p>
<i>Claudia</i> - 60s throwback?  Would be OK with another singer.  This guy brings anything down.  Song is really repetitive and boring.  Peppy, I'll give it that.

</p>
<p>
<i>Street Lights</i> - I was reading up on this band during this song and completely tuned it out.  A little more plodding.  This music either needs a chick singer or it needs to step it up, rock out more and get a real singer.  This guy is generally awful with a few moments of acceptability.

</p>
<p>
<i>Wasteland</i> - I should never get to track 13 on an album.  That is entirely too many songs and I've still got two more album cuts (and two live cuts) to go.  This has a ska groove, which I'm digging, but his accent is really coming out and ruining.  Very punky in the chorus.  Probably fun live, but it's not saving this album.

</p>
<p>
<i>Typical Time</i> - Harmonica must be destroyed.  All harmonicas, saxophones and "world" instruments should be taken and shot into the sun.  John Popper can keep his, though.  Thank god it's over in 33 seconds.  Awful.

</p>
<p>
<i>Posh Boys</i> - Another punky number.  Sounds like it was written in high school.  Arrangement is amateur and lame.  Probably fun live, I guess, but I don't know why I'm being made to listen to this.  Messy rock that we have enough of in this world.
</p>
<p>
The live tracks sound pretty much like the recorded ones (at least based on the 5 seconds I bothered listening to).  Superstar Tradesman + Wasted Little DJ's + Same Jeans + Posh Boys would be a pretty great EP.  Every other song on this album is absolutey horrible.
