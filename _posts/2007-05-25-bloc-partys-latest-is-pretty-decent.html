<b>Overall: 3 Stars</b>
<!--more-->
<p>
<i>Song for Clay (Disappear Here)</i> - This song requires some trust, cause it starts off with just him singing, which can go either way.  Thankfully, they go into a driving upbeat number.  I dig the guy's voice and that makes up for the lack of significant hook.  It works as an opener, but I probably wouldn't dial this track up on purpose.

</p>
<p>
<i>Hunting for Withces</i> - Intro is annoying, but I love the guitar part.  The arrangement is very cool and keeps me interested and keeps up the energy without just smashing cymbals and hammering power chords.  Too many guitarists forget they can just play a single-note line and keep me going.  The chorus isn't super strong, melodically, but his voice + cool arrangement + awesome drum beats keeps me into it.

</p>
<p>
<i>Waiting for the 7.18</i> - His voice carries these boring parts.  Thankfully the drummer comes in with a good creative beat.  Thank god for him.  When everything comes in, this song is pretty awesome.  I want to crank it up and I want him singing louder.  You know a band is cool when half of them are totally cool not playing during the verse.  There's nothing but him, cool drumming and some gay keyboard bells, and it's all good.  I care so much more about guitar when I get a fucking break from it.

<p>
<i>The Prayer</i> - Slower number that is made interesting by the creative drummer yet again.  I love this guy.  When the keys and stuff comes in, it picks up energy and I'm into it.  It ultimately goes nowhere, though.

</p>
<p>
<i>Uniform</i> - Another nice single-note guitar riff starts off this song.  It really sucks until it picks up halfway through.  Still lacking a strong hook, but the arrangement keeps it interesting.  Gets better and better as it proceeds.  I need the first minute eliminated.

</p>
<p>
<i>On</i> - Starts off horribly annoying and takes forever to get to the point.  When it does, though, it's pretty good. I initially gave it 4 stars, but am dropping it to three, cause, well, it could be so much better.

</p>
<p>
<i>Where Is Home?</i> - Kind of noisy and meandering.  Nothing really grabs me here.

</p>
<p>
<i>Kreuzberg</i> - Mellow number carried by minimal guitar and good drum beats.  If this band had a different drummer, they could very well suck ass.  He fills in a lot of what's missing in these songs.  Like everything else on this album, there isn't a big hook to bring me back.  THe vibe is cool and I wouldn't fast forward it, but I'm waiting for the song to "go" and it just never does.

</p>
<p>
<i>I Still Remember</i> - This is the single, cause I got a video with the download.  And this song SHOULD be the single and it IS awesome.  Starts off with a great guitar part and jumps right into a great verse.  I can't say much for the lyrics, but I don't care, as long as they aren't just plain stupid.  When the chorus comes in, it's like "finally" a decent chorus.  Takes a bit long to get there, but the verse kept me occupied nicely.  The guitar is great.  Proper use of backing vocals.  Dear Harmony: you are overrated; I'm now in love with Call & Response.  And one of the <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?p=23">Three Drumbeats of Doom</a>, the Disco Beat, makes its triumphant return toward the end.  Awesomely awesome.  Can't get enough.

<i>Sunday</i> - I'll give them credit for keeping the songs distinct, but sticking to a stylistic theme as well.  This song's got a better hook than most of the other tracks.  Don't know about the lyrics, but again, they are chattering on about "world war three" or some other retarded shit, so I'm cool.  This is a lower energy number that picks up in the chorus and I'm pretty into it.  The guys voice makes up for a lot.  A lesser singer would be boring the shit out of me with this song.  Not like he's technically awesome, just pleasant to listen to.  The "guitar solo" is awesome.  No noodling.  No blues.  4 measures and then the chorus comes in ontop.  Exactly how it should be. Upgraded to 4 stars just for that.

</p>
<p>
<i>SRXT</i> - I hate slow songs.

</p>
<p>
<i>Cain Said to Abel</i> - I guess you only get this via iTunes.  The song name is stupid, but this track rocks out.  I'm loving the fact that this band rarely plays actual chords on the guitar.  Best chorus on the whole album.  Thank GOD it was included.
</p>
<p>
I am digging this album, however I can envision a much better set of songs.  Maybe their first album delivers that.
