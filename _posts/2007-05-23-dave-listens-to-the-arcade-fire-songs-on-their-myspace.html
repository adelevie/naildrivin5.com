<i>"In the Backseat"</i> - sounds like Bjork but not annoying enough/too
annoying.  After two minutes of really monotonous droning, I'm
skipping to the next song.  The girls voice COULD be used for good,
though.  
<br><b>Conclusion: actively irritating</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>"Windowsill"</i> - a minute in and I'm not sure why there are 8 people in
this band.  The chorus REALLY sucked.  Incredibly repetitive and
boring so far.  I get it, he doesn't want to live in his fathers house
no more.  The lyrics are really really stupid.  Were they raiding
Anti-Flag's trashcan for these?  It's finally picked up at 2:28 just
long enough for me to be REALLY pissed that they stopped picking it up
and brought it back down to snoozeville.  "World War Three when are
you coming for me?"  Give me a break.  Axe the first minute, improve
the lyrics and this song would beat "not listening to music".
<br><b>Conclusion: forgettable/mildly annoying</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>"Wake Up"</i> - Dear Mid Tempo: I hate you. Anyway, the verse is very
boring and I'm not sure what the chorus is exactly.  I'm two minutes
in and nothing memorable or compelling has occurred.  The lyrics
aren't grabbing me, which I would count as a good thing.  Still not
sure what all these people do; I guess they are all singing the silly
choir-practice backup vocals?  
<br><b>Conclusion: forgettable</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>"Rebellion Lies"</i> - Better than the rest, but I hate the whispy buried
vocals.  Really hate it.  Sing your songs like you mean it.  At least
this one has some energy to it.  If this had better singing I could be
into this song, but the guy's voice is just so off-putting and a huge
buzzkill. 
<br><b>Conclusion: listenable</b>
</p>
<p>
I'm afraid I just don't get what is supposed to be so great about this
music.  Is it the ties?
