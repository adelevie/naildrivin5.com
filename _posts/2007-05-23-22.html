title: The Bravery invent their new sound, and it's the sound of lame songs

<p>
<i>Intro</i> - skipped it.  Having the first song called Intro is stupid.  I
guess it's a dig at The Killers who couldn't manage to have their
first track called Intro.  Which is kinda funny. But still.
</p>
<p>
<i>Believe</i> - this song sucks, sorry.  Too slow, no energy.
</p>
<p>
<i>This is Not The End</i> - I am not feeling this groove. Kinda boring.
</p>
<p>
<i>Every Word From Your Mouth...</i> - this is the first The Bravery song on
this album.  I guess if I DIDN'T want to hear songs like this I
wouldn't listen to the Bravery, so why did they just waste my time
with the first two songs? That being said, this is not their strongest
track, but it's still pretty cool.  I can't see putting this on unless
I just didn't have access to the first album, though.

</p>
<p>
<i>Bad Sun</i> - This starts off like a The Bravery song.  Unfortunately,
there is more than one person singing.  If I wanted that, I'd listen
to the Beach Boys.  It's possible that the awful awful sound quality
is a problem.  The chorus is ok.  Kinda anti-climactic.  Sounds like
they tried to recreate Public Service Announcement without SOUNDING
like they tried to recreate it.

</p>
<p>
<i>Time Won't Let Me Go</i> - I'm assuming this is the single, since it has a
link for a video to it.  I guess this is the ballad.  The Ballad is
usually when a band jumps the shark, because it was come up with while
the songwriter was noodling on his acoustic guitar when he should've
been focusing on bringing the rock.  This song is OK, I guess, but I
really have heard my fill of this kind of music, and I didn't need Sam
singing it.

</p>
<p>
<i>Tragedy Bound</i> - right on cue we get ACTUAL acoustic guitar, which I
have zero interest in on a The Bravery record.  Again with excessive
backing vocals.   If this were made into a The Bravery song, it might
be OK.  Since it wasn't, it's not.

</p>
<p>
<i>Fist Full of Sand</i> - One part lame song, half part Sam, smattering of
keyboard blips = don't waste my time with this shit.
</p>
<p>
<i>[ At this point, I feel like I'm 2/3rds of the way into a really bad
episode of SNL.  Not even Hans and Franz can save this trainwreck ]</i>

</p>
<p>
<i>Angelina</i> - Anyone who lets anyone in The Bravery besides Sam and the
keyboard guy have any input into their music should be killed and
recreated as a clone to do Sam's bidding.  This song would be
acceptable on a much better album as some B- filler material.  As it
stands...blah.  Plus, why is there a shitty guitar solo in here?!?!?
If I wanted guitar solos I'd...well, I don't want them.  Even still,
the chorus is OK

</p>
<p>
<i>Split Me Wide Open</i> - Getting Funky.  Ugh.  Mid-tempo must die.  This
is not what I'm listening to this band for.  I guess they are
channeling some U2 here and the chorus is OK, but this is lacking
energy and I can't think of a reason to listen to the second chorus.

</p>
<p>
<i>Above and Beyond</i> - Ohhs and ahhs: stop it now, you are ruining what
might shape up to be an OK song.  Again with the mid-tempo boredom.
The faux-reggae vibe helps it out, though, and it ends up sounding
like a regular The Bravery song just played too slowly.

</p>
<p>
<i>The Ocean</i> - More weepy acoustic guitar bullshit.  Strum and Hum.  God
damn this is awful.  Stop it now.  I'm imaging the lights coming down
and a stagehanad bringing an acoustic out to Sam so he can play this
tripe while the keyboard player does shots and hooks up with groupies.
</p>

Dear The Bravery:
</p>
<p>
A much better follow up to The Bravery is Test Your Reflex. Yes, they
are 80s-nu-wave pop redux.  But at least it's GOOD pop redux and not a
lame attempt to "grow musically".  Growing musically does not mean
slowing down the songs, adding more instruments and having more
backing vocals.  I won't be upset if you don't grow musically.   If
you want to try, do it on your own time, or during the last half of
the album.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>The guy that thought you were better than VHS or Beta, who you can be
sure are still churning out the same
faux-techno-drivel-with-Robert-Smith-minusminus-singing as before,
much to the delight of their 10 fans.
</p>
<p>
P.S. Every Word + Angelina + Split Me Wide Open + a bunch of actually
good The Bravery songs would've been great.  As it stands, this album
SUCKS and will not be purchased.
</p>
