<p>Stopped by the new Mexican place in Adams Morgan called <a href="http://www.oaxacaindc.com/">Oaxaca</a>.  Their menu is heavily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/Mole">mole</a>-based, but has numerous non-mole themed items.  I really don't like Mole and this was confirmed by the appetizer I had, which was corn tortillas soaked in mole, topped with black beans and cheese.  The dish was quite good, though I just don't like the sweet/chocolate mole flavor.

<p>
The meal started off with fairly spicy jicama sticks, seasoned with lime.  I had previous not really dug jicama all that much, but their "chips & salsa" pre-appetizer snack was amazingly flavorful.  For my main dish I had their steak soft tacos.  It was the <b>exact</b> same dish as Baja Fresh's "Tres Tacos", right down to the seasoning and inclusion of lime wedges for last-minute seasoning.  Of course, the meat was of much higher quality, and the rice and beans were far and above any fast-food place.  It also came with a small helping of this corn and mayonnaise salad, which I totally could have gone for more of.  It was like the "executive" tres tacos.

Since my meal was "just like Baja Fresh, but better", plus had beer, good jicama and an appetizer, I put this place into the Order of Mexican Food, which is a list I maintain of all the Mexican places I've eaten at and who's better than who.  For the purposes of this list, "Mexican" food is defined as a tortilla/meat/cheese dishes, that claim mexican or southwestern or south american heritage, and use appropriate spices.  So, yes, I know what "Tex Mex" is and all that crap.  Anyway, <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcx2xb2s_0frstpw">here's the list</a>.
