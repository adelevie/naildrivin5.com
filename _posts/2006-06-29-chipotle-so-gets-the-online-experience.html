So, every other week or so, my co-workers and I venture down to Chipotle to get the "best" burritos on the East Coast.  It's usually packed and we'd taken to faxing in our orders via their handy fax order form.  We show up, the orders are ready, we site and eat and no waiting in line.  Perfect.

Today we find we're out of fax forms.  I figure Chipotle might have a PDF on their site that we can print out and do it.  Well, they don't but they DO have an "order online" feature, which should be much simpler than writing on and faxing a piece of paper.

First up, their flash app opens a popup which Firefox blocks.  Fortunately, whichever version I'm using has a handy feature to open select popups that a site has blocked and I open their ordering system (also a Flash app).  Next, I have to create a customer account which requires entering my email address <b>twice</b>, but my passowrd only <b>once</b>.  WTF?!?!?  Anyway, it was mostly painless.

Next I identify which store and I'm off.  I enter the name of the person ordering and then am brought through the ordering process, <b>exactly as I would be</b> in the store, complete with mexican-accented speach asking if I want sour cream and cheese.  And, just like in the store, you have to pass one person before going to the next.  I can't tick off that I want green salsa and carnitas, I have to first answer which kind of meat I want and then, and only then, am I allowed to request a particular type of salsa.

The thing is (and the thing that constantly baffles me about Flash apps) is that it it <b>so fucking</b> overly complex and makes a very simple task just painful.  I should be able to just tick off whichever things I want (which is basically how the fax form works) and submit.  After creating one person's "meal", we decided to just go and stand in line, as that would be less painful.  I'm sure some designer/flash developer tugs at his genitals with glee every time the voice actor asks "leaduss?" in her just-accented-enough-to-give-authentic-flavor voice, but he's clearly never actually used it to order something (or apparently ordered food online <b>ever</b>).

Compare this to Papa John's which basically involves clicking on the size, ticking the toppings and clicking "checkout".  I'm not going to Chipotle for the <i>experience</i> of a fast-food burrito.  I'm going because it tastes OK and I can get it <i>quickly</i>.  It seems the designers of the website just don't get that.
