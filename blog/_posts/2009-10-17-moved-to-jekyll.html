title: Moved my blog to Jekyll

<p>
Kinda wanted a change of pace, so I moved my website over to <a href="http://www.github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which has been fun to set up.  Plus, I actually spent more than 10 seconds on a site design.  I'm assuming my many hours of labour could've been done by a real designer.
