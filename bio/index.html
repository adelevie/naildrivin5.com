    I'm a programmer with over 15 years' experience.  I've done a lot of Java, but have paid my dues
    in C, done a lot of Ruby coding on the side, and more than dabbled in Scala.  I'm currently learning
    how to program for the iPhone.  You can read all about the jobs I've had on
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcopeland">on LinkedIn</a>.  If you'd rather read code, I'd suggest one of
    the following:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gli">GLI</a> - a Ruby library for creating awesome command line applications</li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/shorty">Shorty</a> - a Scala web-app for URL shortening</li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gliffy">Gliffy</a> - The Ruby library for interfacing with <a
            href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy's</a> API</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    I also love talking to other geeks as well as speaking at user's groups and conferences.

    Last but not least, I also like writing about code and technology.  See my 
    <a href="/scalatour">Java Developer's Tour of Scala</a> as well as
    <a href="/blog/2010/03/08/object-oriented-design.html">various</a>

    When I'm not coding, I'm either cooking food or playing <a href="/music">bass</a>.
